## Idea Synopsis

### Who are we

We are a group of three sophomore students. The team members are as follows:

1. Anuprava Chatterjee ([@theartist007](https://github.com/theartist007))
2. Prabhpreet Singh Sodhi ([@pprabh2007](https://github.com/pprabh2007))
3. Prashant Shishodia ([@pshishod2645](https://github.com/pshishod2645))

All three of us are from different regions and different backgrounds and have a diverse understanding of the conditions of calamities in our region. This would, I believe help us in fabricating a better solution.

### What are we planning to build
